tests
-----
include tests with different geometries (open shell, curves etc ...)
step_ocaf
Python 3 tests
doctests?

iges
----
extract iges version when importing
roots and shapes -> have a look at iges file format spec
build the shell and solid from connected faces (pretty complicated / network theory / find groups of interconnected faces)

step_ocaf
---------
complete review + tests
looks weird to only consider compounds and solids while reading file. What about edges etc ...

issues
------
importing iges box -> 24 edges
importing step box -> 12 edges
